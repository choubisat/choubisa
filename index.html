        <p>Not many are born with a chance for ruling the greatest kingdom of your times. Aha! its such a burden. Its not comfortable to know one may be called <em>great</em> in his own future. Should then one try and become <em>great</em> ? How do one does that anyway. Who exactly is a great king? Ever a good question but hardly ever with a good answer. My thoughts begin to ponder, flashes of mahabharata run over eyelids. </p>
<p>Whose story is mahabharata anyways? It had many great kings but who was victorious at the end? Was yudhishtar truly a great king? Why did he lead his people into great war of destruction? </p>
<p>A child doesn’t get to be child when he is prince. Yudhishtir’s childhood bore the same questions. His mother had let him know as he was eldest of the Pandavas. More so he had lot many things to worry. Him and his brothers may not be safe let alone his inherited rights. In that patriarchal world, he would not have a father.  </p>
<p>The kingdom of hastinapur, was not only the richest but rather a corner stone of the cultured society. Sages, kings and people from far away would come at hastinapur to pay respects to its king. The greatest warrior Bheeshma, was lord protector, none ever dares to cross with him. The most knowledgeable Vidhur was an apt prime minister, his methods are foundations of good governance. Both these great men put their life and talents to serve kingdom of hastinapur. It was provided with all possible wealth and luxuries known to man at that time. No wonder these two would want a capable ruler to hand over the reins. </p>
<p>Yudhishtir’s uncle Dhritrashtra was ruling over it. Though, only in his name, since he was blind. The mechanics of ruling were left for Bheeshma and Vidhur to run. There was his son, another contender for the throne, Duryodhana. Both Yudhishtir and Duryodhana were chasing the same destiny from their childhood. Duryodhana has always seen his father sit on the throne. The son wished to live like his father, the father wished to fullfil son’s desire. <em>Yet the question of great king has to be answered for the sake of Bheeshma and Vidhur.</em>  The deserving will have be chosen in <strong>honour</strong> of their services. </p>
<p>The princes grew next to each other. They shared teachers, house, food and what not, raised as true brothers. But the underlying race have always kept them apart. Two groups competing with each other. Never on the same side. Time flowed as river, they remained apart as river banks. </p>
<p>Duryodhan, a king’s son, enjoyed favours from courtiers and everyone around. Its not hard to imagine the beatings, Yudhishtir confidence have known in his childhood. Hardships are known to give strength to character. A king must specially know how to behave in a loss, without losing anything more.</p>
<p>The brothers grew up. Duryodhan as a famed and feared mace warrior. Yudhishtir might have been avid reader, a sincere student, but nothing much. It was his younger brothers Arjun &amp; Bheema, who were great warriors. As the fate turned, Hastinapur was divided between Yudhishtir and Duryodhan. Yudhishtir was rewarded for being the eldest. He had talents of Arjun, Bheema and advice of Krishna at his disposal. Pandavas established new kingdom with capital at Indraprastha. Through their talents, they have earned worldwide respect and proven their might. Pandavas enjoyed the bliss of life at Indraprastha. </p>
<p>A great king might have consolidated from this situation to lead his subjects into peace and prosperity. But only tragedy awaited Yudhishtir. The twists of fate which ends at the bloodiest war of those times. The blissful tenure at Indraprastha came to hasty end when Yudhishtir accepted Duryodhan’s invite for gambling. </p>
<p>How come Yudhishtir have not known the pitfalls of gambling? Could he not seen through the evil webbings? Why did he accept the invite? Which foolish king looses his kingdom, brothers and even his queen-wife in a gamble of game? Oh! what prompted such grand folly? Such elements at play, on the game night of chaupar, invoked from deepest scars on the heart of Yudhishtir. Even <em>chakravrati samrat Yudhishtir</em>, much more famous and affluent than Duryodhan,  could not miss any chance to defeat Duryodhan in a one-on-one fight. </p>
<p>The one enticing pleasure had him fully intoxicated. Yudhishtar who became great with the talents of Arjun, Bheema and Krishna was convinced, he could smash Duryodhan’s false ego. This one thought consumed all his brain, becoming his only desire. He could not leave albeit without victory. His compulsions might have originated from all the scars and injustices he carried from his own childhood. The more the man gambled and more the emperor lost. Greatness of others have made him an emperor, vices of his lost the empire. The game of deserving has turned tables on him. </p>
<p>The shock of defeat and humilation of Druapadi made Yudhishtir realize his mistake.He understood the penance it required. He accepted the terms of vanvaas and an year of hiding in all its verbatim. It started the mark of his greatness. Henceforth, Yudhishtir goes on to accquire great wisdom. He has given up on all his agonies and kept himself true. </p>
<p>The episode of <em>Yaksha-prashna</em> by the end of their vanvaas is a testimony his accquired greatness. Through his own journey, from a prince to Samrat, to again begging and wandering in forest, Yudhishtir has learned true essence of life, society and kingship. He has gained command over the subject of dharma, hence became the Dharmaraja.</p>
<p>He comes out after fourteen long years. Yet, his demeanour commanded loyalties of a large army for his sake. Blood price to rectify past mistakes had to be paid. The great war was fought. The armies of Yudhishtir were victorious. He was coronated as one true king of Hastinapur, the deserving one, who could take the baton forward from Bheeshma and Vidhur. He ruled peacefully for many years to come and laid the foundations for new age of men. </p>
